# Hello! I'm Harsha 👋👋🏾 👨🏾‍💻

<img src="https://github.com/harshagv/harshagv/blob/master/20200407_153146.jpg" alt="banner that says Harsha - cloud devops engineer, content creator and community organizer alongside a cartoon illustration of Harsha">
I'm a Cloud DevOps engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. I recently was selected to be an inaugural <a href="https://stars.github.com/">GitHub Star 🌟</a> based on my involvement in the tech community.  My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch <a href="https://www.meetup.com/React-Ladies/">React Ladies</a>, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
